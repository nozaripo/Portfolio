# üÜóü§ñüñ•Ô∏è Interpretable AI 
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Interpretable AI for Medical Imaging Data](https://github.com/hhaeri/Interpretable-AI-for-Medical-Imaging) | Ongoing | Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Variational Auto Encoder | Focus of my research is to provide interpretable deep learning models for processing and classification of medical imaging data. The current research efforts are directed towards the refinement of multiple regularization techniques tailored for enhancing the performance of a novel VAE architecture named CLAP. |
| [Interpreting an Image Classifier](https://github.com/hhaeri/Interpreting_Image_Classifiers) | Sep 2023 | Python, PyTorch, OmniXAI, HuggingFace | Developed and implemented an image classifier interpretation tool. The pipeline encompassed utilizing a pre-trained RESNET model to create predictions for selected images and employing model-agnostic interpretation tools via OmniXAI to delve into the underlying rationales guiding the model's decisions. |
| [Interpreting Text Classifiers and Benchmarking Explainers](https://github.com/hhaeri/Interpreting-Text-Classifiers) | Sep 2023 | Python, PyTorch, FerretXAI, HuggingFace | Developed and implemented a text classifier interpretation tool. The pipeline encompassed utilizing a pre-trained NLP model to peform sentiment analysis for selected movie reviews and employing model-agnostic interpretation tools via FerretXAI to delve into the underlying rationales guiding the model's decisions. |

# ü§ñüß†üñ•Ô∏è Deep Learning 
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Digit Classification for MNIST Dataset Using MLP Backpropagation](https://github.com/nozaripo/Deep-Learning-Projects-Sample/blob/main/MNIST/MNIST--BackProp.ipynb) | Jan 2020 | Python, NumPy, SciPy | Developed and implemented an image classification model for classifying digits in the MNIST dataset. The pipeline encompassed developing a multi-layer perception (MLP) and performing a manual backpropagation on this MLP using only `numpy` and not other ML-specific frameworks. |
| [Image Classification for Fastion-MNIST Dataset using Neural Networks](https://github.com/nozaripo/Deep-Learning-Projects-Sample/blob/main/Fashion%20MNIST/MLP%20-%20Fashion%20MNIST.ipynb) | Feb 2020 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, NumPy, CNN, MiniVGGNet, CUDA | Designed, created, and deployed a custom time series forecasting model to predict county_level daily COVID-19 case count in the State of California using Python and Streamlit on Jupyter Notebook. |
| [Language Classification for Speech Data using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)](https://github.com/nozaripo/Deep-Learning-Projects-Sample/tree/main/Language%20Classification%20-%20RNN) | March 2020 | Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, NumPy, RNN, Librosa, CUDA, AWS | Designed, created, and deployed a custom time series forecasting model to predict county_level daily COVID-19 case count in the State of California using Python and Streamlit on Jupyter Notebook. |

# üìñ„äóÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è Natural Language Processing
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Natural Language Processing with Yelp reviews](https://github.com/hhaeri/NLP-with-Yelp-reviews) | Feb 2022 | Python, Scikit_Learn | Performed Natural Language Processing using the Yelp Review dataset on the kaggle website. Built bag-of-word and bigram models. Built a Naive Bayes model to find the most polar words. Analysed reviews of restaurants to find food bigrams  |

# üñ•Ô∏èüìà Data Wrangling 
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
|  [The New York Social Network Graph Project](https://github.com/hhaeri/The-New-York-Social-Graph) | Jan 2022 | Python, Beautiful Soup, NetworkX, NLTK, Regex, Rest API | Built a social network for New York's social elite by web scraping the New York Social Diary.|
